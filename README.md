# Corona-Virus-Data-Visualization-with-MATLAB
The Coronavirus Data Visualization App is a MATLAB-based interactive application developed using App Designer to analyze and visualize COVID-19 datasets obtained from the Johns Hopkins University repository. The app provides an intuitive interface to explore pandemic data through daily and cumulative case trends, with options for country- or region-level analysis. Interactive plots help reveal growth patterns and comparative insights across different locations. To maximize accessibility, the project was deployed as a standalone application, enabling execution without requiring a MATLAB installation. This project enhanced my skills in GUI development, data handling, visualization techniques, and standalone deployment, demonstrating how MATLAB can be used to build informative and user-friendly analytical tools
